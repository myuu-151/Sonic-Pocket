// Runs the recompiled game on its own thread, one video frame at a time.

// The recompiled code never returns to the host (the game's main loop is an
// endless task scheduler), so it runs on a dedicated thread. The machine's
// frame-end callback hands control back to the host after every frame and
// waits until the host asks for the next one; only one side ever runs.
